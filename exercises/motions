--------------------------- Motions -----------------------------

  Many spells that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
  For example, the delete charm is constructed as follows:

    d   motion

    d      - deletion operator
    motion - is what the operator will operate on.

  Some motions of interest:
    w - until the start of the next word
    b - until the start of the current word
    e - to the end of the current word
    $ - to the end of the line

  Thus typing  de  will delete from the cursor to the end of the word.
