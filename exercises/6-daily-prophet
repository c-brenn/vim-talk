-- You-Know-Who Returns --
In a brief statement Friday night, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge
confirmed that You-Know-Who has returned to this country and is active once more.
"It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself
you know who - is alive and among us again," said Fudge, looking tired and
flustered as he addressed reporters.
"We believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from You-Know-Who.
We urge the magical population to remain vigilant."

The Minister's statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding
community, which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry
assurances that there was "no truth whatsoever in these persistent
rumours that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us once more."

Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy,
though it is believed that You-Know-Who and a select band of followers (known as Death Eaters)
gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.

Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation
of Wizards and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, was unavailable for comment last night.
He has insisted for a year that You-Know-Who was not dead,
as was widely hoped and believed, but recruiting followers once
more for a fresh attempt to seize power.
