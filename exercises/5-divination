------------------------------ Divination & Apparation -------------------------------

We will know learn how to search even the foggiest of files for text of interest,
and how to transform it at our leisure.

* use gg to apparate to the top of the file *
* use G to apparate to the bottom of the file *

G can be combined with a count to apparate to the specified line

* We can search and apparate (forwards) to characters of interest using f and t **

-- Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and
   sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future.

* search for text using / followed by the search term *
* Use n to travel by floo powder to the next matching term *

-- Diagon Alley
-- Knockturn Alley
-- Diagon Alley

( we can turn off the highlighting for the current matches with :noh )

* Type % to apparate to a matching (, [ or { *

-- (parenthesised { pumpkins [ grow larger ] })
